# Distributed Optimization Under a Communication Budget
This repository contains implementations for the numerical evaluations in the paper:

*Rajarshi Saha, Mert Pilanci, Andrea J. Goldsmith*, **"Efficient Randomized Subspace Embeddings for Distributed Optimization Under a Communication Budget"** (Currently under review)

Please note that this repository is still a work in progress and there might be some issues related to platform dependencies. Python implementations for distributed optimization (for Linear Regression and CIFAR-10 results provided in the paper) are still needs refactoring and the code will be uploaded soon. Please reach out if you need it sooner.
